  Hi, my name's Brandon and I am currently attending the Georgia Institute of Technologies MS CS program (OMSCS) with a specialization
  in Machine Learning.  
  
  My most recent role was a Systems Services Representative at IBM where I was involved with a lot of hardware repairs on various servers
  and workstations.  Prior to this, I was a recruiter and the sole developer at AMB Construction (designed web page, integrated and created
  database) for a little over two years.  

  My goal is to find a software company where I am able to collaborate as well as work on larger-scale projects, since this is something
  I currently lack.  I have no problem working an associate-level position to prove myself before working into a more graduated role.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>C#</mark>.  I also know Java, Javascript (React, Angular, jQuery), HTML, CSS, and SQL.

          Consumer Mart is a full-stack E-Commerce Web Application that was created with RESTful API services, a relational database, and an angular front-end which was 
          developed with the Repository/MVC architecture on .NET Core Framework.
