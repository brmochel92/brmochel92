  Hi, my name's Brandon and I am currently attending Georgia Institue of Technology as a graduate student in pursuit of my Masters in Computer Science with a specialization in 
  Computing Systems.  I have 4 years of professional experience as a full-stack Software Developer, two of which was spent at IBM as a back-end developer. 

  I am most skilled in: <mark>C#/.NET</mark> and <mark>SQL</mark>, though I also know a number of other languages and stacks, such as <mark>Python/Django</mark> and <mark>Java/Spring Boot
  </mark> and <mark>Node.js/React.js/Angular.js/jQuery</mark>

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
